# Enhanced Participant Deletion Functionality

## Overview

The admin panel now includes comprehensive participant deletion that removes all associated data from the system.

## What Gets Deleted

When a participant is deleted through the admin panel, the following data is permanently removed:

### 1. Participant Record

- Complete participant information from the `participants` table
- Name, phone number, family size, etc.

### 2. Authentication Data

- User authentication record from the `auth` table
- Login credentials and session data linked to the participant's phone number

### 3. Coupon Data

- All coupons associated with the participant from the `coupons` table
- Both claimed and unclaimed coupons are removed

## Implementation Details

### Database Operations

The deletion process follows this sequence:

1. **Fetch participant data** - Get the phone number from participants table
2. **Delete coupons** - Remove all coupons linked to participant ID from `coupons` table
3. **Delete auth user** - Remove Supabase auth user using admin API (user ID matches participant ID)
4. **Delete participant** - Remove the main participant record from `participants` table

### Auth Table Structure

- Users are registered with email format: `phoneNumber@isgcon.com`
- Auth user ID matches the participant ID for data consistency
- Deletion uses Supabase auth admin API: `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(id)`

### Error Handling

- Each deletion step is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- If any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back
- Detailed logging helps with debugging and monitoring

### User Interface

- Clear confirmation dialog warns about permanent deletion
- Lists all data types that will be removed
- Cannot be undone warning

## Usage

### From Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Participants section
2. Click the red trash icon next to any participant
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
4. All associated data is permanently removed

### Confirmation Dialog

The system shows a detailed warning:

```
Are you sure you want to completely delete this participant?

This will permanently remove:
• Participant record
• Authentication account
• All associated coupons

This action cannot be undone.
```

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated admin users can perform deletions
- All operations are logged for audit purposes
- Database foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## Testing

The functionality has been tested to ensure:

- ✅ Participant record is removed
- ✅ Auth account is deleted
- ✅ All coupons are removed
- ✅ No orphaned data remains
- ✅ Statistics are updated correctly

## Code Location

- **AdminContext.tsx**: `deleteParticipant()` function
- **AdminDashboard.tsx**: `handleDeleteParticipant()` function

## Future Enhancements

- Add soft delete option (mark as deleted instead of permanent removal)
- Bulk deletion for multiple participants
- Export data before deletion option
- Detailed audit log of deletions
