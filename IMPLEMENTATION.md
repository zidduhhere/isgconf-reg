# Time-Based Meal Coupon System Implementation

## Overview

We have implemented a time-based constraint system for the ISGCONF meal coupon application. This system ensures that meal coupons are only active and available for claiming during their designated time slots.

## Features

1. **Time Status Detection**: Ability to determine if a meal slot is upcoming, active, or past based on current time
2. **Visual State Management**: Different visual states for meal cards based on time status
3. **Claiming Prevention**: Prevention of claiming meals outside their active time windows
4. **User Feedback**: Clear visual and textual indicators for meal availability status

## Implementation

### New Files

1. `/src/utils/cardHelpers.ts`: Helper functions for determining card visual states
2. `/docs/time-constraint-system.md`: Documentation for the time constraint system

### Updated Types

Added the `MealTimeStatus` type to `/src/types/index.ts`:

```typescript
export type MealTimeStatus = "upcoming" | "active" | "past";
```

### Updated Components

1. **MealCard**: Updated with time-based states and visual indicators
2. **CouponContext**: Updated to validate meal time constraints before processing claims

## Testing

We've created tests to validate:

1. Time utility functions correctly determine meal time status
2. Card visual states correctly reflect time status
3. Card styles, icons, and text are appropriate for each state

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Verify the UX with real users to ensure clarity of the time constraints
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Test the system at state transition boundaries (e.g., exactly when a meal becomes active)
3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching time calculations to minimize recalculations

## Conclusion

The time-based meal coupon system now ensures that users can only claim meals during their active time windows. This enhances the user experience and prevents invalid claims outside of meal serving times.
